# Tiny applets
A personal collection of small applets and command line tools that do not warrant
their own repository. I've implemented these primarily with Python and JavaScript,
but I made use of other programming languages and / or technologies as well.

## List of applets

### ECTS grade calculator
**Technologies used**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Want to see how well you've done in college? Enter your grades into the calculator
and it'll give you your final grade.

### Study helper
**Technologies used**: Python

Particularly useful for studying. Import a text document with your notes and
the study helper will ask you questions based on what you've written in your
notes.

### Pokémon coverage checker
**Technologies used**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Check how your team's coverage fares against all Pokémon types. May be useful
for teambuilding.
