# Tiny applets
A personal collection of small applets and / or command line tools that do not
warrant their own repository. I implemented these primarily with Python and
JavaScript, but I occasionally made use of other programming languages and / or
technologies as well. Refer to the ``README`` of each individual applet for more
information.

## List of applets

Where did the time go? Track how much time you spend on different activites,

A classic game that probably everyone has played at least once. Control a snake

Yet another classic and equally as popular game. Take control of a paddle and
