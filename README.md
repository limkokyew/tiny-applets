# Tiny applets
A personal collection of small applets and / or command line tools that do not
warrant their own repository. There is no particular topic these applets focus
on - some of them are neat tools to help with organization and some are command
line games and so on.

I implemented these primarily with Python and JavaScript using as few libraries
as possible, but I occasionally made use of other programming languages and / or
technologies as well. Refer to the ``README`` of each individual applet for more
information.

## Usage

### JavaScript
Currently, all JavaScript applets can be run simply by opening the respective
HTML file in a browser.

### Python
To run a Python applet, execute the following command in a terminal window:

```bash
python <filename>
```

Some applets may require certain libraries to be installed - for instance, the
timer app uses the package ``pyqt5``. In order to install such packages, I
recommend setting up a virtual environment:

```bash
python -m venv venv
```

On Windows, activate your virtual environment using:

```bash
cd venv/Scripts
activate
```

On Linux, activate it using the following command instead:

```bash
. venv/bin/activate
```

Once activated, change into the directory of the applet you want to run and
execute the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

You should now be able to run the applet using ``python`` as usual.
