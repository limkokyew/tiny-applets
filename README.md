# Tiny applets
A personal collection of small applets and command line tools that do not
warrant their own repository. I implemented these primarily with Python and
JavaScript, but I made use of other programming languages and / or technologies
as well. Refer to the ``README`` of each individual applet for more information.

## List of applets

Want to see how well you've done in college? Enter your grades into the
calculator and it'll give you your final grade.

Particularly useful for studying. Import a text document with your notes and
the study helper will ask you questions based on what you've written in your
notes.

### 🎇 Pokémon coverage checker

Check how your team's coverage fares against all Pokémon types. May be useful
for teambuilding.

### 🕔 Timer app

Where does the time go? Track how much time you spend on different activites,
such as studying or relaxing, and if necessary, adjust your schedule
accordingly!
