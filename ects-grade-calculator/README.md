# ðŸŽ“ ECTS grade calculator
After basically every semester, you probably have this feeling of dread over
your head, thinking whether or not you've done well in your exams and how
potential results may affect your grade. With this calculator, you can calculate
your overall grade and how future results affect your grade.

## How to use
Simply open ``ects-grade-calculator.html`` with your favorite browser.

From here, you can enter the courses you've enrolled into each semester, their
respective ECTS and the grade you've achieved in that course. You can add new
courses to a semester using the ``Add new course`` button. Add new semesters
with the ``Add new semester`` button.

Once you're done entering courses and grades, click the ``Calculate`` button
on the right. The calculator will then show your results for each individual
semester as well as your overall grade across all semesters.
