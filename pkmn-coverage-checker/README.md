# ðŸŽ‡ PokÃ©mon coverage checker
Whenever I was theorycrafting PokÃ©mon teams for the post-game content, I always
wondered: How does my team stack up in terms of coverage? Having lacking
coverage can result in some walls to be nearly impossible to break. This simple
coverage checker allows you to check your team's coverage.

## How to use
Simply open ``coverage-checker.html`` with your favorite browser.

From here, drag and drop the types your coverage encompasses into the
``Selected types`` box. The ``Results`` box will automatically be updated
accordingly. Types are sorted into columns based on your coverage - types that
your team cannot hit effectively are put into the red column, whereas types that
can be hit for at least effective damage are inserted into the blue column.
Types your team can hit super effectively are sorted into the green column.
